Welcome to my "Odin Project Projects". 

Here I will post my works in progress and final submissions to complete The Odin Project curriculum. Some updates may be slow while I am working a fulltime job and doing this on the side. It is my intent to showcase my learning capability to potential employers here as well as teams looking to integrate someone! Thank you for stopping by!
