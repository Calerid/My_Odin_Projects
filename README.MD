Hello & Welcome to my "Odin Project Projects". 

This repository is dedicated to my learning experience with web development. I am a fulltime firefighter, husband, and father to four - programming is something that I have always been interested in learning and becoming proficient at. Here I post my progress and show the effort I have put into the projects laid out by The Oden Project. Some of these are completed and some are current works in progress - denoted by the WIP section.

Due to my obligations I have taken a few breaks in my learning to program - some short, and some extended. I keep comming back because... well, this is something I want! It might be in a few months and it might be years from now. I am not giving up though. One day I will write solid code and help make working websites :)!

Current WIP:

Completed:

Google Homepage (HTML / CSS)
